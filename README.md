ConqueringCuriosity
===================

You are Dr Henry Jekyll - and someone has broken into your laboratory and stolen your secret serum! Now the whole town is in chaos as violent animals, doused in the dangerous potion, are out to get you. You must switch to and from your alter-ego, the dangerous, ill-hearted Mr Hyde to find clues and apprehend the villain!
